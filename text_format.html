    <p>In Maharashtra, converting land in a Green Zone to other uses like residential or commercial is generally not permitted, 
        though some exceptions may exist under specific circumstances and with strict conditions. Green zones are primarily designated
         for agricultural and environmental protection, and conversions for non-agricultural purposes are heavily restricted. </p>

     <p>Both states honor their heritage with parades, cultural events,
         and reflections on their journey towards becoming economic 
         and cultural powerhouses within India. Every year on May 1, while much of the world observes International Labour Day, two Indian states mark the date with a different kind of pride and purpose.1 May 2025</p>

    <p class="line_heigth">Computers and electronics play an enormous role in today's society, impacting 
    everything from communication and medicine to science.Although computers are typically 
viewed as a modern invention involving electronics, computing predates the use of electrical devices.
 The ancient abacus was perhaps the first digital computing device. Analog computing dates back several millennia as primitive computing devices were used as early as the ancient Greeks and Romans, the most known complex of which being the Antikythera mechanism. Later devices such as the castle clock (1206), slide rule (c. 1624) and 
Babbage's Difference Engine (1822) are other examples of early mechanical analog computers.</p>
